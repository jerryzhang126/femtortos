	  bump pointer to the next item which is removed.

	  terminology.

	* src/femtoRTOS.c: Fixed walk through the list.

2006-01-12 11:48  yaworsky

	* src/femtoRTOS.c: delay_current_task() should not modify the list
	  which a task belongs to.  When a task is suspended on PSO it is
	  not just removed from the ready list but it is moved to another
	  list before this function is called.	So move the code that
	  removes a task from the ready list to the sleep() function.
